# Git Tutorial

When using the command line, there are some important commands that can be used to apply git. Some commands that I want to point out to you include:
* git clone <GIT_URL>
* git add <FILE>
* git commit -m <MESSAGE>
* git push 

## git clone

The clone command is important because it allows for you to download a GitHub repository into your own repository. Once this repository has been cloned to your computer, it is in what is known as the working tree. The working tree consists of all the files on your computer. 

## git add & git commit

The add and commit commands are utilized to push a file to a different data storage spot. The git add command takes files from the working tree and pushes them to the staging area. The staging area includes all files from the working tree that are ready to be committed to the local repository. The local repository consists of all committed files and to push a file into the local repo you need to use the git commit command.

## git push

The push command is important because you can use it to update Github with the changes you made in your personal files. the push command means that your file can be viewed on other computers. The file is located in what is known as the remote repository.

## Stashes and Branches

Using stashes is important because you are able to take two branches of the same project and merge them together to make one file. Each branch is based off the same project, but have unique changes made. It is possible to make the two branches merge together to make one cohesive file. One such way of doing this is rebasing. Rebasing is the process of taking one unique branch and adding its changes onto another branch with changes of its own. You can call the rebasing function by using **git rebase**.
